# Content Creation and Content Writing

We've all heard the adage, "Content is king." But in Orwellian jest, we ask, "Is all content created equal? Or is some content more equal than others?"

You see...it's not 'content' that's going to get you more visitors; it's 'quality content'--you know, the kind of content that grabs you by the balls and threatens to hold you in agony until you read the next sentence. Do I have your attention now...?

Okay, you may not like to be grabbed that way, but you get the picture right? No one wants to read an article you paid some writer a penny a word to write. Content like that is being ripped from the Google rankings as we speak. It's like a wasteland of words. Do us a favor, don't hire those other content creation service companies who will just add to the waste...

Of course, we're biased, cause we want you to hire us. So here's how our content writing service is more equal...

## The Art of Quality Content Creation

We start with the end in mind. This means our content creation is actually a part of your overarcing business strategy! I know, a weird concept, right? But you can't imagine how many people want to just run out and hire a blog writer to write hundreds of low quality articles to fill up their site. DON'T DO IT! Finish reading this first...

Think of your content as a true investment, a part of your website real estate that's going to be around for years and years.

You see...high quality content serves multiple purposes and if you understand this from the beginning, then you'll really understand why you need quality content and not just any ol' content. Your content is going to:
Interest visitors--> giving visitors a reason to link to your website-->creating higher search engine rankings-->bringing more visitors--> which starts the cylce all over again.

This cycle repeats, and builds upon itself a thousand fold. One good piece of content that is properly researched, targeted to garner specific inbound links from high quality sources, and well written for its audience could get you ten, twenty, even forty inbound links to your website. Just to give you an idea of what that's worth, one link from a directory might cost you $50-$300. So 40 links is worth anywhere from $2000 to $12000. Do you really think that hiring a writer for $.01 a word is going to get you that kind of return? I guess you could just put all your money on red...

Then again, you could just choose to hire us. We mmay not be the cheapest, but you wouldn't want that anyway. We follow a very natural, and methodical method for creating high quality content for your website. This may include articles, videos, audio interviews, howto guides, or other types of specific content.

Give us a call or email us today to discuss how our quality content creation services can help propel your website into the top rankings.
