At our core, we're Ruby on Rails developers. 

We’ve been developing custom Ruby on Rails applications since 2006. We immediately fell in love with the Ruby programming language and the Rails web framework because they allow us to focus on helping our clients build great applications quickly.
Flatterline is all about agility.

We know you don’t have time to mess around; you need something rapidly. Whether your goal is to have something to pitch to investors or sell to potential customers, we’ll work with you to get the right set of features to meet your goals, in your timeframe.

Not everything is known.

It’s been our experience that you’ll discover things about your business that were previously unknown as we begin development. We’re masters at quickly adjusting to these changes, but we’re also experienced enough to say ‘No’, when needed.

We know it’s easy to get caught up in the excitement, only to find months later that what was built was not what was actually needed. We’ve seen projects do this. Hell, we’ve worked on projects in the past that have done this.

Let our experience help to guide you and keep you focused on the real goals.

We love the thrill of creating new apps...the speed at which we can bring your idea to market...and the reach your custom web application gives you.

Cause when we’re not building software for you, we’re developing our own projects and contributing our skills to the open-source software community. Cause for us, it’s more than just a job, it's a lifestyle.
