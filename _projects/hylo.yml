    "Flatterline has been an absolute pleasure to work with over the last year and a half.
    They use their development expertise to bring tremendous ideas to the table that will
    help further a company along, not just to \"get the job done.\"


    I would highly recommend Flatterline to anyone looking to ensure their technology
    will be deployed efficiently, on-time, and in line with the company goals. I would
    be happy to speak directly to anyone who would like additional information about the
    high quality of their work. <a class='value' href='tel:+16029035972'>602.903.5972</a>."

    "Flatterline is more than a development firm, they are a trusted resource for us.
    When we hired Flatterline we expected great things but we got so much more. As
    with every startup, you sometimes create impossible situations yet the Flatterline
    team was able to take each challenge and deliver. They continually communicated
    with us so that we were always on the same page concerning the direction of my
    startup. It's that kind of concern and dedication that I look forward to working
    with Flatterline for many years."

    "I worked with the Flatterline team on Humshakal.com and Hylo.
    I've worked with many product development teams, both internal and external,
    and I can say definitively that the Flatterline team is one of the best around.


    Their technical abilities are first class and they are strong communicators.
    And probably most importantly, they look beyond the technical aspects of the
    project to ensure that the user experience and business objectives are achieved
    in the product."

    "As a founder of and advisor to numerous software startups, I can attest to the
    value of Flatterline for Rails Development. Emerging, early stage companies need
    developers that combine vision, innovative thinking, creativity, velocity and a
    strong work ethic. If your company is in need of development support, Flatterline
    is a no-brainer."
