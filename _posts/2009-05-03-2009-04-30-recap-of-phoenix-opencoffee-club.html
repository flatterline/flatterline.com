<p>We had a great turnout for the first <a href="http://flatterline.com/index.php/2009/04/24/phoenix-opencoffee-club/">Phoenix OpenCoffee Club</a>, which took place April 30th at <a href="http://www.azfairtrade.com/cafe/">Fair Trade Cafe</a>. About a dozen people, both entrepreneurs and investors, attended and spent several hours getting to know each other over some great coffee.</p>

<p>We heard at least 6 ideas pitched and discussed during the 2 hours we were there. The assembled group wasn't shy about asking questions and raising concerns of the entrepreneurs pitching their ideas either. I know everyone appreciated hearing the perspectives of entrepreneurs and investors alike. We hope everyone who attended found the meetup engaging and useful. We sure did!</p>

<p>Special thanks to Fair Trade Cafe for allowing us to host our event there. The <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/2561649/">May 7th Phoenix OpenCoffee Club</a> will be held at Hob Nobs Coffee House. We'll try to have OpenCoffee Club every Thursday, so it's not a big deal if there are times you can't make it. Hope to see you there!</p>
