LaunchSpot is a tech incubator in Tempe, AZ. Although they got rolling about a year ago, they've spent a lot of time and money developing their space, located at Broadway and 52nd Street in Tempe, Arizona. In fact, here's a video tour of the coworking space before it was built out:

### What is the LaunchSpot Rapid Pitch Event?

As a part of the [Tempe Geeks Night Out](http://www.tempe.gov/business/scitechfest/), LaunchSpot will be offering 6 early stage startups the opportunity to pitch entrepreneurs and investors on their idea. They will be given four minutes to pitch and six minutes for Q&A.

They'll compete to receive a chance to get venture funding and other prizes including free office space at LaunchSpot, legal consultation with lawyers from Wong, Fuji & Carter, PC on business law, legal consultation with Wright Law Group, PLLC on intellectual property law, and more.

### So, how do I apply?

You need to do just two things to be considered for the LaunchSpot incubator.

1. Create a two-minute video about your idea. No getting out of it, this is required&hellip; make sure you address what your idea is, how it helps people, who it helps and why you're so passionate about it.
1. Fill out the online application form by the February 3rd deadline.

You need to do the video first, because once you've made your video, you must upload it to YouTube and include a link to the video in your online application.

LaunchSpot will feature video submissions on their site and allow users to vote on the ones they like most. The video with the most likes will be offered an automatic place in the Rapid Pitch event.
