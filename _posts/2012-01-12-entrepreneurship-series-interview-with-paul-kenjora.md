You may not have heard of Paul Kenjora, but anyone who's able to raise $1.5 million for a startup is worth listening to. In this article, Paul shares some of his thoughts about entrepreneurship, startups, funding, what worked for him and what didn't.

## What Projects Are You Working On Now

Launch it to your customers, not your friends. I'm more interested in marketing than getting feedback about how cool my project is.


This goes way back to ASU, I hung out with a crowd of startup people. Every one of my friends is involved in a startup today. They were exactly the wrong way to do a startup each time...

I have three startups 

My first startup was Cork Office. It was suppose to be an online office. Ironically, it was a lot like Facebook. So I came close...but not quite the same.

Then, the other one was an IT service. We were able to analyze what kind of software you were running, when you needed an update. We were able to do all this remotely. So it was analytics for an office space.

After that one, I got tired of doing B2B projects, just going in and competing against companies like Microsoft, and realizing the industry is more about connections. At that time I was only 23, and someone who's 23 doesn't have a lot of connections. So at some point we realized ths project was just DNR and just let it go.

It was a learning experience, so I said no more B2B.

That's when I did something called One-a-Month, which I think every developer should do. I basically did a project each month. And the rules were, one weekend, and it couldn't interfere with anything social. So if a friend called me and said, let's go to coffee, I'd go. I had to start it on Friday night and finish it by Sunday night. And finish it meant push it out to the web.

Sometimes I did really quick projects, but they started getting more elaborate. 

So that was fun, but it was a learning experience. That's when I was learning [Python](http://python.org/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). And a couple months into it, that's when I created this last start up that I just came out of. And that was odd. I put it up, it was a terrible website, download this plugin and run it on WordPress. And the denver post started using it.

So I loggged in one day and the server was down. The server was a machine inside my house that was also my media center. So while I'm watching Netflix, it's serving this startup. That's called bootstrapping, right?

You do what you have to do, right? Cause it worked. I then moved everything to Amazon EC2. But it grew. Of all the One-a-Months I was doing, this is the one that got traction. And I thought, why not go with it?

So I started pursuing it. Raised a lot fo money, put together a team, and made all the mistakes that a funded startup can do.


Didn't have our priorities straight about how to market it

About 6 months ago, I departed from it. Off doing my own stuff now.

How Hard Was It To Walk Away

There's a little sheet of paper on my desk that has a list of things I want in a startup.

Consumer based
Can't be B2B
It has to be something I can do. In other words, it has to be within my talent pool.
Has to make the world a better place
People have to be willing to pay for it.

But one of the things I actually wrote down the day I decided to raise money for it was: I need to be willing to walk away from it. The reason I wrote that down is because at that time, I was more interested in going through the process of a funded startup, than I was about the outcome. Of course, I was hoping for a good outcome, but I had read a lot of statistics where most first raises fail, and since this was the first time I'd raised money for a company, and given my track record, I figured this one wasn't going to go so well either.

And it went okay for a while. But the decision in the end was to sacrifice my own beliefs, or walk away knowing I have plenty of startups ahead of me, and all the lessons I've learned from this one will be amazing.

So I look back on that decision to walk away from it...but the cool thing about it is, someone else is in my place, the technology is out there, somebody's doing it.

## How Was the Experience of Raising Money

I spent a year, just working on raising money. Going to investor pitches, writing business plans, putting together one pagers, rehearsing my elevator pitch, walking into every writing workshop on how to write a pitch and pitch investors. I was raising money in Arizona, so this wasn't Silicon Valley.

There are a lot of investor events, but they're more like get togethers for people who have money to invest. So if you just find one or two, people will invite you to the rest. You may go to some events that aren't investor events, but when you look around at all the people, you think, this is just like an investor event.

The reason for that is Phoenix was historically a real estate
